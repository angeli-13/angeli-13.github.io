Hi! I'm Angela Li, a 1st year MEng in EECS at MIT. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and optimization. I am particularly interested in improving trustworthiness and reliability in AI systems through uncertainty-aware evaluation and developing techniques for reliable decision-making.

It was a pleasure to be invited to speak at the <a href=https://www.bostoncccc.org>Cambridge Center for Chinese Culture</a>. Not only was it a great opportunity to give back to the community, but I also learned a lot of new things. The students were so enthusiastic and I was impressed by their fluency. Through this event, I felt more connected to the Chinese community in the Cambridge area.
